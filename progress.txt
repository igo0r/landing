## Codebase Patterns
- CSS variables defined in src/index.css for consistent theming
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck (no npm script configured)
- Build with `npm run build` to verify all changes work
- Components have co-located CSS files (e.g., Header.tsx + Header.css)
- Use react-icons for icons (e.g., FaLinkedin from 'react-icons/fa')
- Use `import type { X }` for type-only imports (verbatimModuleSyntax enabled)
